### Can I use the SmartArmStack libraries without ROS/ROS 2?

Yes! The [**SmartArmStack**](https://github.com/SmartArmStack) packages provide modularized 
robot control tools for ROS and ROS 2. Each device can be used directly through C++ or 
Python without ROS, through their **sas_robot_driver** interfaces. 
Then, using inheritance and subclass polymorphism, each device is individually managed 
through ROS by an instance of **sas_robot_driver_ros**. 
In general, each robotic device will have different configuration requirements and 
those are handled in a modular way through configuration files.

### What robots are supported in SmartArmStack?

Roughly speaking, all robots, sensors, and actuators are compatible with the [**SmartArmStack**](https://github.com/SmartArmStack)
framework as long as you implement their respective **sas_robot_driver** interfaces.
